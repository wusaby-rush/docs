> **ImageMissingAlt**: The alt property is required. (E03022)

## What went wrong?
The `alt` property allows you to provide descriptive alt text to users of screen readers and other assistive technologies. In order to ensure your images are accessible, the `Image` component requires that an `alt` be specified.

If the image is merely decorative (i.e. doesn’t contribute to the understanding of the page), set `alt=""` so that screen readers know to ignore the image.
